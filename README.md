AI-BSP is an online, general purpose POMDP solver with both state-dependent and
entropy as reward functions. It uses an adaptive approach to increase
computational efficiency at run time; for more details please see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05673). For the mathematical proofs and derivations see the attached [appendices](https://github.com/moranbar/Adaptive-Information-BSP/blob/main/Adaptive%20Information%20Belief%20Space%20Planning%20Supplementary.pdf) file.

To run the code, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run
main.jl.
